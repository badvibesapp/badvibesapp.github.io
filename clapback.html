    "Letâ€™s circle backâ€¦ eventually.",
    "I appreciate the urgency, but letâ€™s be realistic.",
    "Thatâ€™s a great idea. For someone else.",
    "Iâ€™d love to chat about this, but I have another meetingâ€¦ forever.",
    "This is a top priorityâ€”right behind my actual priorities.",
    "Let me run this up the flagpole and see who ignores it.",
    "Iâ€™d love to brainstorm, but Iâ€™ve reached my thinking quota for the day.",
    "Let's put a pin in that and forget where we put it.",
    "This seems like a great opportunity for you to take the lead.",
    "I hear your concerns, but my interest level remains unchanged.",
    "Letâ€™s sync on this after I miraculously find time.",
    "I value your input, even if I donâ€™t plan to act on it.",
    "Interesting take. Iâ€™ll be sure to consider it when I have time. I wonâ€™t.",
    "I think we have different definitions of â€˜urgentâ€™.",
    "Iâ€™d love to help, but that sounds like a you problem.",
    "Iâ€™ll look into itâ€”right after I finish not doing that.",
    "Iâ€™ll flag this for follow-up. Eventually. Maybe.",
    "Iâ€™m currently optimizing my workflowâ€¦ by avoiding this.",
    "I'll check my schedule, but I wouldnâ€™t get my hopes up.",
    "Great suggestion. Iâ€™ll add it to the pile.",
    "I see your point, but I also see my workload.",
    "That sounds like a fantastic initiative for next year.",
    "My calendar is pretty full, but Iâ€™ll be sure to pretend to consider this.",
    "Iâ€™d love to get to this, but unfortunately, I do not.",
    "This is outside my expertise, but best of luck.",
    "Sounds like a great stretch goal. For someone else.",
    "I'll get back to you when my motivation returns from its vacation.",
    "That sounds like a great use of your time.",
    "Iâ€™d love to provide feedback, but I donâ€™t want to.",
    "Letâ€™s hold off until itâ€™s relevant. If ever.",
    "This would be great for someone with bandwidth. Not me, though.",
    "Iâ€™d love to collaborate, but I also value my sanity.",
    "I have so many thoughts on thisâ€¦ none of them useful.",
    "Letâ€™s park this idea somewhere and forget where we left it.",
    "I think this would benefit from some additional overthinking.",
    "Thatâ€™s an ambitious deadline. Good luck with that.",
    "Thatâ€™s a great idea. You should definitely own that.",
    "Iâ€™ll need some time to pretend to think about this.",
    "Let me run the numbers. *Opens calculator, types 911*",
    "Iâ€™d love to workshop this, but that sounds exhausting.",
    "This is an excellent initiative. For another team.",

    "Thatâ€™s a fascinating problem for someone else to solve.",

    "Letâ€™s pivot this discussion toward someone who cares.",
    "Iâ€™ll absolutely consider this. In the distant future.",
    "I think we should wait and see if this resolves itself.",
    "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but Iâ€™m choosing peace.",
    "I see the issue, but I also see my weekend approaching.",
    "Iâ€™d love to dive into this, but my coffee is empty.",
    "This needs further analysis. By someone else.",
    "Thatâ€™s an interesting take. Letâ€™s not pursue it.",
    "Iâ€™ll give this the attention it deservesâ€”minimal.",
    "Iâ€™ll take a look when Iâ€™m in the right headspace. Never.",
    "This would be more effective if I had time to care.",
    "Thatâ€™s a priority, just not for me.",
    "I could jump on this, but I choose not to.",
    "This is a great initiative. Iâ€™ll cheer from the sidelines.",
    "Iâ€™d love to, but I have prior engagements with my sanity.",
    "Iâ€™ll let you know if I develop an opinion on this.",
    "Thatâ€™s a great insight. I will promptly ignore it.",
    "Iâ€™ll look into this right after my next existential crisis.",
    "Iâ€™ll let you take point on this exciting new adventure.",
    "That sounds like a future problem. Letâ€™s keep it there.",
    "Iâ€™d love to help, but I have another excuse prepared already.",
    "I'll be sure to revisit this idea when the stars align.",
    "I'm sure this will work itself out. Without me.",
    "Iâ€™d love to contribute, but I also enjoy free time.",
    "This is a great opportunity for someone with fewer boundaries.",
    "Iâ€™ll review this when I have the emotional bandwidth.",
    "Thatâ€™s an interesting proposal. Iâ€™m not interested.",
    "This is exactly the type of thing I should avoid.",
    "I appreciate your optimism, but Iâ€™m more of a realist.",
    "Thatâ€™s a great question. Letâ€™s avoid answering it.",
    "Iâ€™ll touch base when I figure out how to care about this.",
    "Letâ€™s connect on this at a later, unspecified date.",
    "This sounds important. Let me pretend to take notes.",
    "This is a fantastic topic for another meeting that I wonâ€™t attend.",
    "Iâ€™ll look into this once my email backlog stops haunting me.",
    "I could take this on, but why would I?",
    "Iâ€™d be happy to discuss this. In theory.",
    "Iâ€™ll need to check if Iâ€™m legally required to care.",
    "I would love to help, but I have other ways to suffer.",
    "Iâ€™ll be sure to mention this in my next complaint.",
    "This is a challenge Iâ€™ll let someone else accept.",
    "Iâ€™d love to say yes, but Iâ€™m also a fan of honesty.",
    "I could do this, but that wouldnâ€™t be in anyoneâ€™s best interest.",
    "Iâ€™d love to revisit this once I develop an interest.",
    "Letâ€™s take this offline and then never bring it up again.",
    "Iâ€™ll add this to my list of things to avoid.",
    "Thatâ€™s a bold assumption about my availability.",
    "This would be a great initiativeâ€¦ for another department."
